**Function Generator** is Windows desktop application, which aims to help the lovely engineers in **GFaI GmbH** to simulate the ***sensor signal*** for main software using in water jet cutting factory. 


# Motivation

In the process of developing a main software for project water jet cutting factory (ES Leistand 4.0) database plays an important role. It stores the communicating signal of all sensors in the factory, so that the main control system can analyze the sensor's signal, knows state of devices… and issues proper actions. Therefore, we need to build a software to simulate all sensors' signal. And **Function Generator** comes up with the answer :). This software helps to generate data for database, simulate the operation state of sensor from operating parts of factory
